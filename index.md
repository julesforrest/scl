  copy:
  - When we help teams ship and iterate core features, we focus on the total experience — not just the pixels in their app. When we storyboard, we draw what’s happening in the world and what’s happening in their product. We also help Sequoia companies tell their story and build healthy design orgs with the structures, processes and measurement tools they need to thrive.
  - Along the way, high-performing designers join the Sequoia Creative Lab for fast-paced, one-on-one, hands-on projects as Design Fellows and Visiting Designers. Design Fellows typically have 1–5 years experience and an urgent desire to sublimate their design career with a big jump forward while Visiting Designers bring their expertise on specific topics for short-term projects.

    position: Design fellow '17
    intro: Jules is a product designer who first became interested in design and typography while working on her college's newspaper in upstate New York. A stickler for details, she likes building design systems that prioritize consistency over pixel-perfection. After she leaves the lab, she's looking forward to joining a team where she can continue to develop her front-end skillset.
