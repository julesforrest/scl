  headline: Welcome to the Sequoia Creative Lab
  copy:
  - Influenced by storied studios of the past—from the Bauhaus and the Eames Studio to Total Design and Xerox Parc—the Sequoia Creative Lab employs a full-process approach to design problems. Leonardo da Vinci haunts our workshop with whispers of encouragement or provocation as we attempt to blend art and science. Jeanne d’Arc gives us conviction to follow our vision, even when others offer hostility or indifference. Nature offers us clues to the architecture of the sublime. We read many sources. We learn from many fields.
  - We design for the Sequoia partnership and portfolio. Our projects center on total experience—not just the pixels in your app—so when we storyboard, we draw what’s happening in the world, not just what’s happening in your product. For more, read Human Experience Design.
  - Along the way, we transform high-potential designers into tomorrow’s design leaders through the hands-on mentoring and active collaboration of our Design Fellows program.

    headline: For the love of type
    copy: Jules is a product designer and front-end developer who first became interested in design and typography by working on her college newspaper in upstate New York. She joined the Sequoia Creative Lab to explore the industries within the Sequoia portfolio and collaborate with the portfolio's design teams. At work, she builds design systems that prioritize consistency over pixel-perfection. Offscreen, she’s usually hiking, listening to music that other people tell her is incredibly depressing, or nerding out about type.
