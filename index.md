  - We read many sources. We learn from many fields. Our projects center on total experience — not just the pixels in your app — so when we storyboard, we draw what’s happening in the world and what’s happening in your product.
  - We help Sequoia Capital companies build healthy design orgs with the structures, processes and measurement tools they need to thrive. We roll up our sleeves and help teams ship and iterate core experiences. Think of us as your partners in design.
  - Along the way, we transform high-performing designers into tomorrow’s design leaders through the hands-on mentoring and active collaboration of our Design Fellows program.
