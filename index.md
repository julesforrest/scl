  - When we help teams ship and iterate core features, we focus on the total experience
    — not just the pixels in their app. When we storyboard, we draw what’s happening
    in the world and what’s happening in their product. We also help Sequoia companies
    tell their story and build healthy design orgs with the structures, processes
    and measurement tools they need to thrive.
  - Along the way, high-performing designers join the Sequoia Design Lab for fast-paced,
    one-on-one, hands-on projects as Visiting Designers.

    position: Designer
    intro: I specialize in consumer product design and illustration. I've worked on a wide range of projects at startups like Twitter and Medium, but I've also engaged in traditionally non-tech spaces with activists like Gloria Steinem. I believe technology should serve empathy and connection. I love telling stories and this is mine!
